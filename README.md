* A small express, node.js, mongodb and react-redux app I'm making to practice redux with react and also authentication using jwt.
* The app is not complex enough to require redux but still large enough to practise using redux with react
* For styling I used css, bootstrap and react-bootstrap. I could just stick to one but I want to be comfortable using multiple methods.
* Items created by the users will be deleted in 7 days if nobody bids on them, bidding on the items resets countdown, 7 days after the last bid the payment option comes up for the user in their profile and in the same section the user can view the situation of the items they chose to bid on.
* The user will be able to edit the item if as long as no bidding has occured, to make it more appealing or maybe just to correct a typo.
