* A small express, node.js and react-redux app I'm making to practice redux with react and also authentication using jwt.
* For styling I used css, bootstrap and react-bootstrap. I could just stick to one but I want to be comfortable using multiple methods.
* Probably gonna deploy the app once it's finished to heroku or netflify.
* A link to the live app will be provided here.
