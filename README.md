* working on implementing stripe.js payment method, but not the react one, I need to learn the plain javascript for more flexibility.
* Haven't cleaned up yet, full of typos !!! You have been warned :)
* A small express, node.js and react-redux app I'm making to practice redux with react and also authentication using jwt.
* The app is not complex enough to require redux but still large enough to practise using redux with react
* For styling I used css, bootstrap and react-bootstrap. I could just stick to one but I want to be comfortable using multiple methods.
* Probably gonna deploy the app once it's finished to heroku or netflify.
* A link to the live app will be provided here.
* Items created by the users will be deleted in 7 days if nobody bids on them, bidding on the items cancels countdown.
* The user will be able to edit the item if as long as no bidding has occured, to make it more appealing or maybe just to correct a typo.
